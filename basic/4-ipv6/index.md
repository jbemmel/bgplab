# Configure BGP for IPv6

In the previous lab exercises, you [configured EBGP sessions with two upstream ISPs](2-multihomed.md) and [advertised IPv4 prefixes to them](3-originate.md). Now, let's add IPv6 to the mix.

![Lab topology](topology-ipv6.png)

The routers in your lab use the following BGP AS numbers. Each upstream router advertises an IPv4 prefix, an IPv6 prefix, and the default route.

## BGP AS Numbers
| Node/ASN | Router ID | Advertised prefixes |
|----------|----------:|--------------------:|
| **AS65000** ||
| rtr | 10.0.0.1 | 192.168.42.0/24<br>10.0.0.1/32 |
| **AS65100** ||
| x1 | 10.0.0.10 | 192.168.100.0/24<br>2001:db8:100::/48 |
| **AS65101** ||
| x2 | 10.0.0.11 | 192.168.101.0/24<br>2001:db8:101::/48 |

Your router has these EBGP IPv4 neighbors. _netlab_ configures them automatically; if you're using some other lab infrastructure, you'll have to configure them manually.

| Node | Neighbor | Neighbor IPv4 | Neighbor AS |
|------|----------|--------------:|------------:|
| rtr | x1 | 10.1.0.2 | 65100 |
| rtr | x2 | 10.1.0.6 | 65101 |

You will also have to establish IPv6 EBGP sessions with the upstream ISPs using these parameters:

| Node | Neighbor | Neighbor AS | Neighbor IPv6 |
|------|----------|------------:|--------------:|
| rtr | x1 | 65100 | 2001:db8:42::2 |
| rtr | x2 | 65101 | 2001:db8:42:1::2 |

## Start the Lab

Assuming you already [set up your lab infrastructure](../1-setup.md):

* Change directory to `basic/4-ipv6`
* Execute **netlab up** ([device requirements](#req), [other options](../external/index.md))
* Log into your device (RTR) with **netlab connect rtr** and verify IP addresses and basic BGP configuration.

*netlab* will configure IPv4 addressing, IPv6 addressing, and BGP for IPv4 on your router, resulting in a configuration similar to what you should have done in [Advertise IPv4 Prefixes to BGP Neighbors](3-originate.md).

If you're not using *netlab*, continue with the configuration you made during the [previous exercise](3-originate.md) and add IPv6 addresses to your router's loopback- and WAN interfaces before proceeding.

## Configuration Tasks

You have to:

* Establish IPv6 EBGP sessions with the upstream providers.
* Advertise IPv6 prefix `2001:db8:1::/48` to them.

Most BGP implementations treat IPv4 and IPv6 in almost the same way and use **address families** within BGP configuration to configure them. The details vary:

* On many devices (including Cisco IOS, Arista EOS, Cumulus Linux, and FRR), you must configure IPv4 and IPv6 BGP sessions within the BGP configuration and then *activate* those sessions within individual address families.
* Some devices (for example, Nexus OS) expect you to configure BGP neighbors *within the address families*
* You might encounter older implementations (for example, old Cisco IOS versions) that configure IPv4 parameters within BGP configuration and IPv6 parameters within the IPv6 address family.

I know you'll figure out those details. Just keep in mind that there's not much difference (usually) between IPv4 and IPv6, and you already know how to [setup EBGP sessions](2-multihomed.md) and [advertise IPv4 prefixes in BGP](3-originate.md). Just do the same thing for IPv6.

## Verification

You can use the **netlab validate** command if you've installed *netlab* release 1.7.0 or later and use Cumulus Linux, FRR, or Arista EOS on the external routers.

![](basic-ipv6-validate.png)

If that command fails or you're using another network operating system on the external routers, it's time to start a troubleshooting session.

Before digging into the details, check that the IPv6 BGP sessions are up. Use a command similar to **show bgp ipv6 summary** to verify that:

```
rtr#sh bgp ipv6 unicast summary
BGP summary information for VRF default
Router identifier 10.0.0.1, local AS number 65000
Neighbor Status Codes: m - Under maintenance
  Description              Neighbor         V AS           MsgRcvd   MsgSent  InQ OutQ  Up/Down State   PfxRcd PfxAcc
                           2001:db8:42::2   4 65100              9         8    0    0 00:00:09 Estab   2      2
                           2001:db8:42:1::2 4 65101              9         8    0    0 00:00:09 Estab   2      2
```

!!! Warning
    For historical reasons, many network devices have an inconsistent CLI command structure -- the IPv4 BGP commands are more straightforward than IPv6 BGP commands. For example, you can use **show bgp summary** on Arista EOS to display BGP summary information for the IPv4 address family. At the same time, you have to use **show ipv6 unicast summary** to display the same information for the IPv6 address family.

The IPv6 prefixes you want to advertise to EBGP neighbors must be in your router's BGP table first. A command similar to **show bgp ipv6** or **show bgp ipv6 unicast** is thus a good starting point. This is how Arista EOS displays it:

```
rtr#show bgp ipv6 unicast
BGP routing table information for VRF default
Router identifier 10.0.0.1, local AS number 65000

                    S - Stale, c - Contributing to ECMP, b - backup, L - labeled-unicast
                    % - Pending BGP convergence

 *        ::/0                   2001:db8:42:1::2      0       -          100     0       65101 i
 * >      2001:db8:1::/48        -                     -       -          -       0       ?
 * >      2001:db8:100::/48      2001:db8:42::2        0       -          100     0       65100 i
 * >      2001:db8:101::/48      2001:db8:42:1::2      0       -          100     0       65101 i
```

However, you really want to know if the prefixes are advertised to the EBGP neighbors. Some network devices have a **show** command that displays prefixes advertised to a neighbor. Here's how that command works on Arista EOS:

```
rtr#show bgp neighbor 2001:db8:42::2 advertised-routes
BGP routing table information for VRF default
Router identifier 10.0.0.1, local AS number 65000

                    % - Pending BGP convergence
Origin codes: i - IGP, e - EGP, ? - incomplete
RPKI Origin Validation codes: V - valid, I - invalid, U - unknown
AS Path Attributes: Or-ID - Originator ID, C-LST - Cluster List, LL Nexthop - Link Local Nexthop

          Network                Next Hop              Metric  AIGP       LocPref Weight  Path
 * >      2001:db8:1::/48        2001:db8:42::1        -       -          -       -       65000 ?
 * >      2001:db8:101::/48      2001:db8:42::1        -       -          -       -       65000 65101 i
```

Check the BGP table on the remote router to ensure everything is okay. While that's a bit hard to do in real life, it's trivial in a lab -- connect to X1 or X2 with **netlab connect** (or SSH into them if you're not using _netlab_), start `vtysh` (if you're using Cumulus Linux or FRR) and execute the **show ip bgp** command:

```
$ netlab connect x1
Connecting to container clab-originate-x1, starting bash
Use vtysh to connect to FRR daemon

x1(bash)#sudo vtysh

**Next:**

* If you're interested in BGP routing policies, proceed to [Use BGP Weights](../policy/1-weights.md) to prefer one of the upstream ISPs.
* If you want to build networks with more than one BGP router, continue with [Running BGP in Larger Networks](../ibgp/1-edge.md)

## Reference Information

This lab uses a subset of the [4-router lab topology](../external/4-router.md). The following information might help you if you plan to build custom lab infrastructure:

### Device Requirements {#req}

* Customer router: use any device [supported by the _netlab_ BGP configuration module](https://netlab.tools/platforms/#platform-routing-support).
* External routers need support for [default route origination](https://netlab.tools/plugins/bgp.session/#platform-support). If you want to use an unsupported device as an external router, remove the **bgp.originate** attribute from the lab topology.
* You can do automated lab validation with Arista EOS, Cisco IOSv, Cumulus Linux, or FRR running on the external router. Automated lab validation requires _netlab_ release 1.7.0 or higher.
* Git repository contains external router initial device configurations for Cumulus Linux.
