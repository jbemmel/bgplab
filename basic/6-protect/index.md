# Protect BGP Sessions with Passwords and GTSM

Now that you know how to [configure EBGP sessions](2-multihomed.md) let's see how you can make it harder for someone to mess them up. Two mechanisms are commonly used to protect EBGP sessions (or the control plane/CPU of the router running them):

* Generalized TTL Security Mechanism (GTSM) described in [RFC 5082](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5082) ([more details](https://blog.ipspace.net/2023/03/advantages-bgp-gtsm.html))
* Cryptographic protection (but not encryption) of underlying TCP sessions with MD5 checksums or TCP Authentication Option described in [RFC 5925](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5925).

In this lab, you'll use:

* GTSM on the EBGP session with ISP-1
* MD5 checksum on the EBGP session with ISP-2[^NOL]

If you want to practice BGP session protection with TCP-AO, check out the [TCP-AO lab](9-ao.md)[^NOL].

[^NOL]: I would love to add a TCP-AO-protected session to this lab, but you cannot use TCP-AO on Cumulus Linux or FRR because it's not yet (as of September 2023) implemented in the Linux kernel. That's the price you're paying for riding on top of other people's infrastructure.

![Lab topology](topology-protect.png)

The routers in your lab use the following BGP AS numbers. Each upstream router advertises an IPv4 prefix and the default route.

| Node/ASN | Router ID | Advertised prefixes |
|----------|----------:|--------------------:|
| **AS65000** ||
| rtr | 10.0.0.1 | 192.168.42.0/24<br>10.0.0.1/32 |
| **AS65100** ||
| x1 | 10.0.0.10 | 192.168.100.0/24 |
| **AS65101** ||
| x2 | 10.0.0.11 | 192.168.101.0/24 |

## Start the Lab

Assuming you already [set up your lab infrastructure](../1-setup.md):

* Change directory to `basic/6-protect`
* Execute **netlab up** ([device requirements](#req), [other options](../external/index.md))
* Log into your device (RTR) with **netlab connect rtr** and verify that the IP addresses are configured on all its interfaces.

If you're using *netlab*, you'll get a fully configured lab, including BGP prefix origination on RTR and EBGP sessions between RTR and X1/X2. If you're using some other lab platform, it's best if you do this lab exercise after the [Advertise IPv4 Prefixes to BGP Neighbors](3-originate.md) one.

## Configuration Tasks

The EBGP sessions with X1 and X2 will not be established because X1 and X2 use EBGP session protection. They might be stuck in `Connect`, `OpenSent` or `OpenConfirm` state as illustrated by the following printout produced on Arista cEOS:

```
rtr>show ip bgp summary
BGP summary information for VRF default
Router identifier 10.0.0.1, local AS number 65000
Neighbor Status Codes: m - Under maintenance
  Description              Neighbor V AS           MsgRcvd   MsgSent  InQ OutQ  Up/Down State   PfxRcd PfxAcc
  x1                       10.1.0.2 4 65100             11        13    0   76 00:00:14 OpenConfirm
  x2                       10.1.0.6 4 65101             10         8    0    0 00:00:12 Connect
```

To make the lab work:

* Configure TTL protection (GTSM) on the EBGP session with X1
* Configure MD5 TCP checksum on the EBGP session with X2. The password used by X2 is `GuessWhat`.

## Verification

Check the state of the BGP sessions with a command similar to **show ip bgp summary**. This is a printout taken from Arista EOS:

```
rtr#show ip bgp summary
BGP summary information for VRF default
Router identifier 10.0.0.1, local AS number 65000
Neighbor Status Codes: m - Under maintenance
  Description              Neighbor V AS           MsgRcvd   MsgSent  InQ OutQ  Up/Down State   PfxRcd PfxAcc
  x1                       10.1.0.2 4 65100             42        63    0    0 00:00:16 Estab   2      2
  x2                       10.1.0.6 4 65101             17        16    0    0 00:00:04 Estab   2      2
```

Finally, use a command similar to **show ip bgp** to display the prefixes your router received from its EBGP neighbors.

## Reference Information

This lab uses a subset of the [4-router lab topology](../external/4-router.md). The following information might help you if you plan to build custom lab infrastructure:

### Device Requirements {#req}

* Customer router: use any device [supported by the _netlab_ BGP configuration module](https://netlab.tools/platforms/#platform-routing-support).
* _netlab_ has to configure default route origination, MD5 password, and GTSM on the external routers. You'll find the supported devices in the **bgp.session** [platform support table](https://netlab.tools/plugins/bgp.session/#platform-support). You must use Cumulus Linux on the external routers if you're using _netlab_ release 1.6.3 or older.
* Git repository contains external router initial device configurations for Cumulus Linux.
