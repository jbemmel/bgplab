# IBGP Load Balancing with DMZ Bandwidth

In the [previous lab exercise](2-dmz-bw.md), you used the DMZ Bandwidth BGP attribute to implement unequal-cost load balancing across multiple links connected to the same router. In this exercise, you'll use the same approach but extend it across your autonomous system â€” routers receiving external routes over IBGP should perform load balancing toward external destinations based on the DMZ bandwidth attached to them.
